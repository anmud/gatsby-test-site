We've written the survey specifically as a starting place for business and technical people just beginning their own journeys with artificial intelligence and are teasing apart what's real from what's hype.

We assume you are involved in creating, managing, or green lighting software and want to understand how AI can give your software super powers (as Andrew Ng is fond of saying). We do not assume you have a computer science degree. The people we had in mind for this microsite include:

- A **software developer** trying to get a broad overview of the products and services available
- A **business analyst, product manager**, marketing manager, or consultant who has heard that machine learning could help improve the product he or she is responsible for but doesnâ€™t have the time to go through all the options
- A **data scientist** looking to broaden their toolkit from basic statistical techniques to the latest and greatest AI toolkits
- A **line of business leader** trying to figure out the right way for their organization to put intelligence into their team's software, processes, and culture
